To get started, we first need to create a new React project using the [Create React App CLI](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

```markdown
$ npx create-react-app postagram
```

Now change into the new app directory and install NPM packages for AWS Amplify, AWS Amplify UI React, react-router-dom, emotion, and uuid

```markdown
$ cd postagram
$ npm install aws-amplify emotion uuid react-router-dom @aws-amplify/ui-react
```
